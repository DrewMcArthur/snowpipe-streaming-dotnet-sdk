# Feature Specification: Channel Drop Method

**Feature Branch**: `002-channel-drop-method`  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Status**: Ready  
**Input**: User description: "channel drop method"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an SDK consumer, I need a clear way to remove a streaming channel and its metadata so that unused channels can be cleaned up safely and predictably.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given an existing channel, When the user requests to drop it, Then the system confirms the channel is removed and no further appends are possible.
2. Given a channel that is still committing recent appends, When the user requests to drop it, Then the system first ensures data is committed up to the expected point before completing the drop; if not complete within a defined timeout, it reports a clear timeout error.
3. Given multiple concurrent requests to drop the same channel, When drop is invoked more than once, Then the system performs a single drop and treats additional requests as no-ops without error.
4. Given a dropped channel, When a user attempts any further operations (append, wait, status), Then the system rejects the operation with a clear error stating the channel is dropped.

### Edge Cases
- Dropping a non-existent channel returns a clear not-found error to the caller.
- Concurrent drop requests are safe and idempotent; only one takes effect.
- Under rate limiting or transient failures, the system retries with backoff and then reports a clear error if still unsuccessful.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Users MUST be able to request dropping a named channel associated with a specific database, schema, and pipe.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST confirm successful removal of the channel and its metadata.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide clear error feedback if the channel does not exist or cannot be dropped.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST support an option to ensure recent data is committed before completing the channel removal.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST expose an operation outcome that is suitable for automation (success/failure with context).
- **FR-006**: The system MUST automatically retry transient failures (HTTP 429/5xx) with exponential backoff for a bounded number of attempts, and report a clear error if unsuccessful.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST enforce a bounded wait when ensuring commit before drop, after which it returns a timeout error if not caught up.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST reject all operations on a channel after it has been dropped.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Channel**: Logical ingestion endpoint identified by database, schema, pipe, and channel name; has lifecycle states and a last-committed offset.
