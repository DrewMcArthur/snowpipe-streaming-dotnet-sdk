# Feature Specification: JWT Functionality

**Feature Branch**: `003-jwt-functionality`  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "jwt functionality"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an SDK consumer, I need clear, reliable JWT handling to authenticate Snowpipe Streaming requests so I can securely exchange my JWT for a scoped token and keep data ingestion working without manual token management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a valid user-provided JWT and account URL, When the client requests an exchange, Then a scoped token is obtained and used for subsequent ingest operations.
2. Given an expired or malformed JWT, When exchange is attempted, Then the client returns a clear unauthorized/bad-request error including useful identifiers.
3. Given a near-expiring scoped token, When an ingest operation is attempted, Then the client proactively handles token freshness or reports a clear error if refresh is required by the environment.
4. Given transient errors during token exchange, When retries are allowed, Then the client retries with backoff and surfaces a clear error if attempts are exhausted.

### Edge Cases
- JWT clock skew leads to not-yet-valid or just-expired tokens; behavior is predictable and clearly reported.
- Multiple concurrent operations do not result in duplicate or conflicting token exchanges.
- Token scopes map correctly to the ingest hostname; mismatched scopes fail with clear unauthorized errors.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST accept a caller-provided JWT and account URL to initiate authentication.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST exchange the JWT for a scoped token bound to the ingest hostname.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST apply the scoped token to subsequent ingest requests.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST surface clear, actionable errors for unauthorized, malformed, or expired tokens, including request identifiers when available.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST avoid redundant concurrent exchanges and ensure thread-safe access to token state.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST retry transient failures (e.g., rate limiting, 5xx) with bounded exponential backoff during exchange.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST handle scope/hostname mismatches by failing fast with a clear unauthorized error.
- **FR-008**: The system SHOULD allow callers to refresh or re-exchange tokens without restarting the client [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: automatic vs. caller-driven refresh].
- **FR-009**: The system SHOULD clearly document token lifetime expectations and any required clock tolerance [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact tolerance window].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **JWT**: Caller-provided credential used to request a scoped token.
- **Scoped Token**: Authorization credential bound to an ingest hostname for streaming operations.
