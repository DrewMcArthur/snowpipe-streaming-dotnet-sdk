# Feature Specification: JWT Key Pair Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `003-jwt-functionality`  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Status**: Ready  
**Input**: Provide key‚Äëpair based authentication that generates the JWT inside the application using a private key and static identifiers pulled from cloud secrets (no manual JWT generation).

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a platform operator running this SDK in cloud environments, I want the application to authenticate to Snowflake using key pair authentication by generating the JWT in memory from a private key and static identifiers sourced from secrets, so that no manual token generation or on‚Äëdisk artifacts are required.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given account identifier, user name, and a private key (optionally encrypted) provided via secret configuration, When the app starts, Then it generates a JWT in memory and successfully calls Snowflake REST endpoints without storing the JWT on disk.
2. Given only the private key and identifiers, When generating the JWT, Then the system derives the SHA-256 public key fingerprint and constructs the payload with the correct fields: iss = ACCOUNT.USER.SHA256:<fingerprint>, sub = ACCOUNT.USER, iat = now, exp ‚â§ now+1h, with ACCOUNT and USER uppercased.
3. Given malformed identifiers (lowercase, region‚Äëqualified account locator, etc.), When JWT is generated, Then the system normalizes as needed (uppercase ACCOUNT and USER, and exclude region from account locator) or returns a clear error if normalization is not possible.
4. Given an encrypted private key and passphrase, When generating the JWT, Then the system unlocks the key securely in memory and never logs or persists secrets.
5. Given transient clock skew (¬±5 minutes), When calling Snowflake endpoints, Then the request succeeds or produces a clear error indicating not‚Äëyet‚Äëvalid/expired JWT.
6. Given concurrent requests, When multiple operations need a JWT, Then a single valid token is reused while fresh, or regenerated when expiring, without races.
7. For requests using key pair authentication, Then the Authorization header is "Bearer <jwt>" and the optional header X‚ÄëSnowflake‚ÄëAuthorization‚ÄëToken‚ÄëType is set to KEYPAIR_JWT.

### Edge Cases
- Missing/incorrect passphrase for encrypted key yields a clear error without leaking secret material.
- The RSA public key fingerprint cannot be computed; the system surfaces a clear error and guidance.
- Excessive JWT lifetime requested (>1h) is capped to 1h; a warning or clear behavior is documented.
- Concurrency: threads attempting to obtain a JWT do not perform redundant work.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST generate a JWT in application code using key pair authentication based on Snowflake guidance.
- **FR-002**: The JWT payload MUST include: iss = ACCOUNT.USER.SHA256:<public_key_fingerprint>, sub = ACCOUNT.USER, iat = current UTC, exp ‚â§ iat + 1 hour; ACCOUNT and USER must be uppercase.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST compute the SHA‚Äë256 fingerprint of the public key derived from the provided private key; a pre‚Äëcomputed fingerprint MAY be accepted but is not required.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST support encrypted PKCS#8 private keys via a passphrase.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST accept static configuration from secret stores or environment (account identifier, user, private key contents or path, optional passphrase, optional fingerprint) and avoid persisting secrets.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST set Authorization: Bearer <jwt> and SHOULD set X‚ÄëSnowflake‚ÄëAuthorization‚ÄëToken‚ÄëType: KEYPAIR_JWT on account‚Äëhost requests.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST handle clock skew and token freshness (e.g., refresh or regenerate shortly before expiration) and ensure thread‚Äësafe reuse.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST provide clear, actionable errors for invalid key, invalid fingerprint, malformed identifiers, or time window violations.
- **FR-009**: The system SHOULD provide ergonomic configuration helpers for cloud secret providers (env vars first; provider abstraction optional).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Private Key**: PKCS#8 RSA private key material (optionally encrypted) provided via secret configuration.
- **JWT**: Token generated in app with required claims and used for Authorization on account endpoints.
- **Public Key Fingerprint**: SHA‚Äë256 fingerprint of the corresponding RSA public key, prefixed with "SHA256:".
